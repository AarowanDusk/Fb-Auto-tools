This repository is dedicated to promoting secure and ethical coding practices. We believe in creating code that is not only functional but also upholds user privacy and system security.

We do not endorse or provide code related to Facebook XSS vulnerabilities or malware libraries. Our focus is on building safe and responsible applications.
